firstly I have saved the data sets into local 
from there I have saved the files into hdfs 
from there I have loaded them into hive by creating external tables for them
later I have queried them by using view command



 dowload data sets and copy them to cloudera /user/cloudera/college
 college contains college_2010.txt,college_2011.txt
 apply contains apply_2010.txt,apply_2011.txt
 student contains student_2010.txt,student_2011.txt
 
drop database if exists project1;

create database if not exists project1;

use project1;

create EXTERNAL TABLE if not exists college(cname string,state string,enrollment int)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t'
Location '/user/cloudera/college';


create EXTERNAL TABLE if not exists student(sid string,sname string,gpa float)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t'
Location '/user/cloudera/student';

create EXTERNAL TABLE if not exists apply(sid string,cname string,major string,decision string)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t'
Location '/user/cloudera/apply';

create VIEW GPA as select s.gpa from student s , apply a, college c where a.major = 'CS' AND c.state = 'CA' AND c.cname = a.cname AND a.sid = s.sid ;


create VIEW reject as select s.sid,s.sname,s.gpa from student s,apply a where a.decision = 'N' AND a.major = 'CS' AND s.sid = a.sid;


create VIEW accept as select s.sid,s.sname,s.gpa from student s, apply a where a.decision = 'Y' AND s.sid = a.sid;
